## 📱 Overview

**SafeSpot** is a next-generation Flutter application that revolutionizes personal safety through intelligent geofencing and AI-powered movement prediction. By combining real-time location tracking with LSTM neural networks, SafeSpot doesn't just monitor where you are—it predicts where you're going and proactively alerts you to potential safety concerns.

Perfect for **personal safety**, **family monitoring**, and **device management** scenarios.

## 🧠 LSTM Movement Prediction Model

SafeSpot's breakthrough feature: an intelligent prediction system that learns your movement patterns and keeps you safe proactively.

### 🔄 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Location Data] --> B[LSTM Model]
    B --> C[Pattern Recognition]
    C --> D[Future Prediction]
    D --> E[Safety Analysis]
    E --> F[Proactive Alerts]
```

1. **📊 Data Collection** — Gathers location points with coordinates, timestamps, speed, and direction
2. **🎯 Pattern Recognition** — Identifies recurring routes and typical destinations
3. **🔮 Future Prediction** — Predicts next locations up to 4 hours in advance
4. **⚠️ Safety Analysis** — Evaluates predicted paths against geofences

### 🎯 Key Benefits

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🚨 **Proactive Safety** | Alerts *before* unsafe situations arise |
| 🗺️ **Route Optimization** | Suggests safer alternatives based on patterns |
| 🔍 **Anomaly Detection** | Flags unusual movements that may indicate emergencies |
| 📈 **Adaptive Learning** | Improves accuracy with continued use |

### ⚙️ Technical Specifications

- ✅ **TensorFlow Lite** integration for on-device inference
- ✅ **Sequence-to-sequence LSTM** architecture optimized for time-series data
- ✅ **Privacy-focused design** with local training
- ✅ **Configurable horizons** (15 minutes to 4 hours)
- ✅ **Real-time updates** based on recent patterns
